opsmill.infrahub Ansible Collection documentation
================================================================


Overview
========

`Infrahub <https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub>` by `OpsMill https://opsmill.com` acts as a central hub to manage all of the information and code that powers your infrastructure. At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars:

* **A Flexible Schema**: A model of the infrastructure and the relation between the objects in the model, that's easily extensible.
* **Version Control**: Natively integrated into the graph database which opens up some new capabilities like branching, diffing, and merging data directly in the database.
* **Unified Storage**: By combining a graph database and git, Infrahub stores data and code needed to manage the infrastructure.

This is the documentation home of the **opsmill.infrahub** Ansible Collection.
